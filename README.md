All projects of the machine learning ND uploaded here for public viewing of the completed projects and the skills gained.

**Project 1: Train a smartcab project**

Used Q-learning agent for training a smartcab to drive to its destination in minimum amount of time without any major or minor accidents. Recieved A+ grade. Minimum passing grade was C.

**Project 2: Image classification on CIFAR-1- dataset using CNN**

Used Convolution Neural Networks to classify images in the CIFAR-10 dataset.

**Project 3: Capstone Project**

Please go through the Project Proposal first.
Used two approaches: 1. Pure Machine Learning to make an ensemble classifier on UCI arrhythmia dataset

2. Deep Learning approach on the MIT-BIH dataset.

Achieved an accuracy of 99% using Machine Learning and 90% using Deep Learning.
